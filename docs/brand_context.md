# Brand Context — Rolling Summaries

This file is intentionally empty initially. It will be populated by the workflow as each prompt (01-04) appends its summary findings.

## Purpose
- Provides quick reference summaries (≤2 pages per prompt)
- Maintains continuity across the workflow
- Used as a lens for downstream prompts

## Structure
Each prompt will append a section in this format:
```
[Prompt Title] — {{RUN_DATE}}
- Key findings and insights
- Summary of main outputs
```

The full detailed outputs are saved in `/outputs/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}_{{BRAND_NAME}}/` for complete analysis.
